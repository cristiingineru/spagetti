**Why another breadboard editor?**

It's not about the breadboard. It's about exercising good coding practices and testing some cool frameworks like:

 - [react](https://github.com/facebook/react)
 - [immutable-js](https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js)
 - [Jasmine](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine)
 - [yadda](https://github.com/acuminous/yadda)

**Current status**

The minimal vertical slice is finished. Tests are currently being added to help growing the project.

**Limitations**

 - Chrome 40
